### Description
R codes for the analyses and the generation of the results shown in manuscript (Dazard et al., 2017). Codes contain randomization, interaction modeling and prediction subroutines. They are needed in addition to the following R packages (http://cran.r-project.org/): [`survival`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival) for Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modeling, [`NADA`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=NADA) for correlation analysis in the presence of censoring, [`randomForestSRC`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=randomForestSRC) for RSF modeling (Ishwaran and Kogalur 2013, 2007), and [`ggRandomForests`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggRandomForests) for Random Forrest exploration/visualization. Default parameter specifications were used for all main functions.
