R codes for the analyses and the generation of the results shown in manuscript Ensemble Survival Tree Models to Reveal Variable Interactions in Association with Time-to-Events Outcomes (Dazard J-E. et al., 2017, submitted)

Codes contain randomization, interaction and prediction subroutines. They are needed in addition to the following R packages (http://cran.r-project.org/): “survival” for Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modeling, “NADA” for correlation analysis in the presence of censoring, “randomForestSRC” for RSF modeling (Ishwaran and Kogalur 2013, 2007), and “ggRandomForest” for Random Forrest exploration/visualization. Default parameter specifications were used for all main functions.
