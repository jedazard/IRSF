Description: Builds ensemble survival tree models to reveal variable interactions when the response is a time-to-events outcome. The current version is a development release. It contains additional R codes in folder "/inst/doc" for the analysis and generation of results shown in manuscript (Dazard et al., 2017, <doi:10.1515/sagmb-2017-0038>). Codes contain randomization, interaction modeling, and prediction subroutines to be used in addition to the following R packages: "survival" for Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modeling, "randomForestSRC" for RSF modeling (Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2013, 2007), and optionally "ggRandomForests" (Ehrlinger, 2014) for Random Forest exploration/visualization.
